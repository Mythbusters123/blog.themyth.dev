This blog is written by a pseudo-programmer, who spends more time learning
about stuff related to programming rather than programming. I also spend time
just learning about stuff in general, such as roadways, legacy cars, Linux, and
whatnot.

For those wondering; my current computer's specifications are:
- CPU: i5-8400
- Memory: 16GB of G.Skill Trident-Z 3600MHz
- GPU: MSI 1060 3GB
- Storage: 250GB ADATA SSD, 2TB Toshiba HDD, 500GB Crucial MX, and another random 500GB SSD

FYI: This is a pre-built meaning that everything not listed here is sub-par or
even just plain bad quality. The case is nice but besides that I'm worried this
PSU will blow at any moment.

I am working on upgrading this, mostly to an all-AMD build, with a Framework
Laptop and possibly Macbook. I currently run Arch Linux and Windows 10 LTSC
cause I am a filthy pirate. When I get a non-operating-system-locked laptop,
that laptop will run Artix Linux with DWM (my modified version based off of
Luke Smith's version) that will dual-boot with Windows LTSC.

The phone I currently use is an iPhone 12 base-model, however I will upgrade
that in the following months to an iPhone 15 with 256GB of storage, unclear on
whether to get the Pro or Pro Max at the moment. I am currently an Apple
"fanboy", however I am not a blind sheep. I personally like Apple not selling
all my data *cough* Windows *cough* and how interconnected the ecosystem is. I
could get along with even less data collection from my good friend Tux the
penguin, but everything doesn't "Just work" as well. Granted, I don't
completely "stan" Apple, but at this case they seem like the worst of many
evils. I'd rather pay the apple tax knowing that I won't be served ads (unless
in the AppStore) and won't have most of my data mined.

I live in the United States, as you could probably tell from the website's metadata;
but I just want to make that clear just in case anyone says something along the
lines of "Murica Moment LOL XD" which is utterly retarded.
