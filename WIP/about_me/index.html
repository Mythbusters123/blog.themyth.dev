<p>This blog is written by a pseudo-programmer, who spends more time learning
about stuff related to programming rather than programming. I also spend time
just learning about stuff in general, such as roadways, legacy cars, Linux, and
whatnot.</p>
<p>For those wondering; my current computer&rsquo;s specifications are:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: i5-8400</li>
<li>Memory: 16GB of G.Skill Trident-Z 3600MHz</li>
<li>GPU: MSI 1060 3GB</li>
<li>Storage: 250GB ADATA SSD, 2TB Toshiba HDD, 500GB Crucial MX, and a 1TB SSD</li>
</ul>
<p>FYI: This is a pre-built meaning that everything not listed here is sub-par or
even just plain bad quality. The case is nice but besides that I&rsquo;m worried this
PSU will blow at any moment.</p>
<p>Other Tech I use currently</p>
<ul>
<li>iPad Air 5<sup>th</sup> Generation</li>
<li>iPhone 12 64GB</li>
<li>Apple AirPods 3<sup>rd</sup> Generation</li>
</ul>
<p>My next setup will be a Framework Laptop with Artix Linux and dwl, with a
MacBook Pro for macOS-only related purposes. I plan to use the Macbook for
uses that rely heavily on battery power. The Framework is a thin-and-light, meaning
that it doesn&rsquo;t have a huge battery, but enough to last a while. The MacBook
will be good for plane rides and such.</p>
<p>The phone I currently use is an iPhone 12 base-model, however I will upgrade
that in the following months to an iPhone 15 with 256GB of storage, unclear on
whether to get the Pro or Pro Max at the moment. I am currently an Apple
&ldquo;fanboy&rdquo;, however I am not a blind sheep. I personally like Apple not selling
all my data <em>cough Windows cough</em> and how interconnected the ecosystem is. I
could get along with even less data collection from my good friend Tux the
penguin, but everything doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Just work&rdquo; as well. Granted, I don&rsquo;t
completely &ldquo;stan&rdquo; Apple, but at this case they seem like the worst of many
evils. I&rsquo;d rather pay the Apple tax knowing that I won&rsquo;t be served ads (unless
in the AppStore) and won&rsquo;t have most of my data mined.</p>
<h3 class="heading">Location</h3>
<p>I live in the United States, as you could probably tell from the website&rsquo;s metadata;
but I just want to make that clear just in case anyone says something along the
lines of &ldquo;Murica Moment LOL XD&rdquo; which is utterly retarded.</p>
