Here is a (very opinionated) list of programs that every person who uses \*NIX
should use. These will be linked to their respective repositories, and this does
not count programs that ship already with most variations of \*NIX. \*NIX is
not NixOS, but every Unix-style OS. Here is the list:

- ZSH&mdash;While a common program on many Unix desktops, it is still a great tool
  and its many extensions on top of Bash, it should be the default shell on any
  personal system. It is much more customizable than Bash, and it makes shell scripting
  easier than ever.

- fzf&mdash;This tool can easily streamline pretty much anything. If you ever want
  to search something using the terminal, then you should definitely use this to find
  and search.

- moreutils&mdash;Dealing with STDIN and out can be hard, annoying, and makes you
    sometimes want to jump off of a cliff. This is just one of the things that moreutils
    helps with. You can make sure that programs don't get data before you're done with it, and
    even edit STDIN using you're favorite editor (default is VIM)

- bottom(btm)/btop&mdash;

- tmux&mdash;

- NeoVim&mdash;

- links&mdash;

- git&mdash;

- lazygit(lg)&mdash;
