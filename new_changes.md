New Changes coming to the domain themyth.dev

I have decided to change up the domain structure of TheMyth.dev. This should be
a non-issue, as I want this to be the main face of TheMyth.dev. The new structure
will be:
- themyth.dev will serve as the minimalist blog site
- mc.themyth.dev will be for the Github group TheMythMC
- git.themyth.dev may never work because gitea likes being stupid
- searx.themyth.dev is the SearXNG instance
- cdn.themyth.dev is a "free" hosting service (email me at atr10605 at hotmail dot com)

This is just going to be what I will host, so thanks for reading
