For the uninitiated, I'm still in High School. That being said, college is right
around the corner, and thus started my search for a laptop to carry around
campus and do actual college work. I currently do have an iPad, but some apps
that I would like to use and need to use for college (especially since I will be
going into an engineering major) are not available and thus make getting a
laptop a necessary purchase.

A solid choice for college students is the all-fabled, legendary Macbook; and
to be honest I am not in opposition of it. However, what concerns me is the
fact that Apple typically tends to have a walled-garden aspect to their
hardware and software that goes a long with their hardware. This could be an
issue, as with talking with other engineering students (especially ones that
are going into my field) tend to use Windows-heavy hardware.
