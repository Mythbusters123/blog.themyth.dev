For the uninitiated, I'm still in High School. That being said, college is right
around the corner, and thus started my search for a laptop to carry around
campus and do actual college work. I currently do have an iPad, but some apps
that I would like to use and need to use for college (especially since I will be
going into an engineering major) are not available and thus make getting a
laptop a necessary purchase.

A solid choice for college students is the all-fabled, legendary Macbook; and to
be honest I am not in opposition of it. However, what concerns me is the fact
that Apple typically tends to have a walled-garden aspect to their hardware and
software that goes a long with their hardware. This could be an issue, as with
talking with other engineering students (especially ones that are going into my
field) tend to use Windows-heavy hardware.

Even with the "Windows-Only" software that colleges make you use for engineering
you can get around that with a Macbook. They can run VMs surprisingly well and
even then if it doesn't work its not the end of the world. (Computer labs exist ðŸ˜‰)

But lets get onto the actual meat and potatoes of this article: What would my
future workstation look like? First off, It would be all laptops. "Why would you
want all laptops?" You may ask. And while that is a good question especially
consdering the lack of performance most commonly found on laptops for the same
price as a good tower computer. However, tower computers come with a drawback.
While they pack in a lot of performance for little price (well not so much
anymore but you get my drift) you can't *easily* take them on a plane much less
USE them on a plane, or even in a car for that matter. How good it is to have a
computer you don't even use that much that you have to use in the plane or in
the car. Portability is what I will strive for in my new workstation, because I
know just how much it sucks to only have your phone or iPad, where those  aren't
really that useable, espeically when it comes to prgramming and doing normal,
every-day tasks with maximum productivity, tablets and phones just don't cut it.

You may have noticed in the previous paragraph that I specified laptops.
Yes, there would be two. Some can already guess why, but to those who havent:
One will be a Macbook (probably  Pro) and a Windows laptop that is able to
dualboot both Windows and Linux. In an ideal world, the setup would look like
this, at the current time. Technology is always advancing, but if I had
around $5,000 right now, this is what I would get (or extrapolated from data
I can predict on):

- Macbook Pro
  - M2 Pro (10  core CPU, 14 Core GPU)
  - 16-32GB RAM depending on workload
  - 1TB SSD
- Framework Laptop
  - Intel Core i7-1260p
  - 1TB NVMe SSD
  - 32GB RAM
  - 1&times;USB-A Expansion Slot
  - 3&times;USB-C Expansion Slot
  - 1&times;Ethernet Expansion Slot

I assume most of you noticed that I did not include a GPU in with this mess; or
even a laptop that comes with a built-in GPU. To be frank, laptops with GPUs are
worse. They have worse thermals, cost an arm and a leg, and look just.. BAD.
This is why opting for an eGPU is just plain better. An eclosure costs around
$300, and since the laptop hardware isn't too powerful a mid-tier GPU such as
the soon-to-be-released AMD Radeon RX-7700XT. This would probably be the perfect
card for my usecase, as even though AMD support for enterprise and engineering
applicatios is sub-par at best, It would be just fine to get me through.
Considering this would be a personal setup to begin with, the computer(s) I
would get from work would be more than adequate for the stuff at work I need to
do. My personal stuff I would like to keep as Linux-compatible as possible
because I personally like Linux and don't want a crappy driver experience.
