For many years, Xorg was viewed as the only option for a display server under
dekstop Linux. However, that is not the case anymore due to the rising
popularity of Wayland. In fact, the developmet for both projects seem to be
inversely related. Xorg has died many deaths, but somehow, through it all it has
remained-somehow. Possibly by the grace of God, other theories suggest it just
might be immortal. However, those days seem to be dwindling. This pushes me to
design my escape root before it becomes too late. If Xorg ever becomes EOL,
some serious poop is going to hit the fan, and Wayland will remain king.

This cause for concern was highlighted recently when the numbers for commits
to the Xorg family of repositories was reported for the 2022 calendar year,
now that we are officially in 2023. Xorg recieved almost no commits for a
project its size, sparking worry in many people's eyes.
