The first to come. The last to go. The be-all end-all of muscle cars. A product
of Henry Ford II in an attempt to increase Ford's market brought about one of
the most iconic cars of not only American history, but known all around world.

### Humble Beginnings {.heading}

The Mustang did not claim itself to be humble. However, the Mustang did not live
up to its name as Muscle car, rather being a car that injected Synthol to look
cooler. Starting out as an Inline (or Straight) 6 engine. Granted, this was
eventually changed to the glorious V8 we all know and love but for it's first
start, it was not the best of looks.
