For a while now, I have wanted to build a NAS. I hate constantly having to swap drives and
add more incrementally, its just a real pain. I would love to have a server, stuffed away
in some closet and just forget about it. I am a data hoarder, and I don't even do anything
related to art. I just like keeping all my movies in one place, all my games, and anything
that should be backed up. Sure, I could do what I am  doing right now, which is paying
$3/month for Google Drive, but I really do not want to be locked into Google's ecosystem.
Thus, to teach all my fellow  internet chads reading this blog, I will teach you all
exactly what you need to build your own NAS!
