Every year at Apple's World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) a multitude of new
frameworks, services, and products are revealed. With these new products, one
always unveiled is the most loved Apple poduct of all time&mdash;the iPhone.
This year will be no different, as they will reveal it just like nomral however
there is one feature that people will be looking out for: the USB-C port news.

First some backstory. Ever since the iPhone 5, Apple has used the proprietary
Lightning connector as an upgrade from the 30 pin charging connector used on
earlier models. This port was built for USB 2.0 speeds which were blazing fast
at the time, but not so much now. With a throughput speed of only around 480
mega*bits* per second. This equates to about 53 megabytes per second, for
example, a one gigabyte file would take 18 seconds to transfer at that speed,
assuming ideal circumstances.
