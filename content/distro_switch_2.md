Well, about a month ago I re-installed Windows. Since then, its been a bit of a
roller coaster, but I've been able to make it work. With all good things in life,
I decided to go out on a whim and completely reinstall everything on that drive,
and I couldn't be happier.

Beforehand, I already switched over my passwords to Bitwarden, which I pay
$10/year (I do not know why I was griping about that, it is actually seriously
reasonable, but the free version works great too!). Now that I have Bitwarden to
manage all my passwords, I can have my passwords everywhere! My phone, my iPad
(which I have to have for school and I only really use it for remoting into my
PC.)

The installation was pretty straight-forward for me. I used the Command Prompt
(Shift+F8 for you uninitiated. ;]) and just wiped the disk, etc.  You know the
drill, skipped the OOBE, and was in a clean desktop without any bullcrap. My
apologies for the last blog post. I misspelled Chris Titus Tech as Chris Citrus
Tech (yes, I'm that stupid). Anyway, it all went off without a hitch until I had
to sign in again on Forza Horizon 5. This required me to log- in with a
Microsoft Account and subsequently decided to make my Office Crack go bye-bye.
This was fixed by a script I used from some random GitHub, which should concern
me but at this point I don't care. I don't use that system for anything mission-
critical.

One thing I've noticed about me is that I just get bored of stuff really easily. I used to really enjoy Minecraft, and now I dont enjoy video games much at all anymore. Also I kinda let this blog just kinda die, which is completely my fauily but I just have a terrible attention span maybe? Whatever it is, I miss my time playing Minecraft and Forza Horizon 5. It just doesn't give me any more creativity or love of the game anymore.
