In recent times, I have been debating on what operating system I wish
to use for my future workstation as described in [this](https://themyth.dev/future_workstation)
document, eventually coming to the conclusion that the only good set-up to
have is all three. (Well, there are more than three but the big three:
Windows, Mac, Linux). This set-up allows practically no compromises aside from
the fact that you have to use 3 different operating systems that don't exactly
like to inter-operate with each other. The main inconsistency is files,
however if you are already spending over $5k for two PCs, using your old one or
buying an old Optiplex and turning it into a NAS (Network Attached Storage)
would combat this issue with ease. I will write another blog post about not
only building, but also picking the exact parts for my NAS which I will (one
day) deploy. A NAS completely solves the issue of sharing important files:
whether it be important documents like .PDF's or .DOCX's but also images,
videos, binaries, or source code. All of this is easy to work off from a NAS,
and with 3 (or more) discrete operating systems or computers, a NAS not only
helps to connect it all, but also adds a layer of organization. The only
things that would not be stored on the NAS would be configuration files (obviously)
and some games that would be loaded onto the Windows operating system.

Now, lets get on to every operating system, or least the ones that are the most
prominent today. Sure, there are some really obscure ones like GNU Hurd or
TempleOS, but those aren't used widley and as such I will not be listing them.
I will split the Linux section into the distros that I use the most and things
that are consistent across most or all Linux distributions.

### Windows {.heading}

Windows is the most used operating system throughout the world. Created by
Microsoft, it has since gained prominence in almost every single aspect of
computing. Everything that you can do on a computer, you can in one way or
another do it on Windows. However, being the most popular doesn't mean
you're the best. Doing some simple tasks on Windows can end up jank-y, and
installing applications is always a hassle.  Many use Windows because
