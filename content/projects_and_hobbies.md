Projects are fun, if you like doing them. For example, Cars. Recently I have
become super invested in cars and even though I am a poor teenager, I really
want to work on one.

If you cannot tell, this is a prebuilt, and a pretty bad one at that. I payed
~$800 for it when 9th Gen came out. Granted, it still works well, but still
kinda annoying. The upgradeability is absolutely awful, and it was built from
the cheapest parts around.

Anyway, what I mostly want to do with my PC is add another GPU (For virtualization
purposes)
