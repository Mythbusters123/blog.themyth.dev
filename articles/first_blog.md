The worst blog you have ever seen!

Not really, it follows the principles of [The Real Web](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com).  
As a self proclaimed Linux minimalist
with a ton of exceptions, I try to follow with the minimalist  principles as
much as possible. Some things I cannot live without, but I do my best to have
everything offline with no internet required. Yet, I am still a soy dev as the
[main site](https://themyth.dev) for this domain is built with Next.JS, but that
is because there are stuff that I can only do with Next.JS and it will happen
(TM). This is just a small blog, posts will be whenever I feel like it. However,
soon I will be documenting my switch from Arch to Artix, because Artix Linux is
infinitely superior.
