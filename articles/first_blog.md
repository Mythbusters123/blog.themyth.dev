The worst blog you have ever seen!

Not really, it follows the principles of [The Real Web](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com).  
As a self proclaimed Linux minimalist with a ton of exceptions, I try to follow with the minimalist  
principles as much as possible. Some things I cannot live without, but I do my best to have everything 
offline with no internet required. Yet, I am still a soy dev as the [main site](https://themyth.dev) for this
domain is built with Next.JS, but that is because there are stuff that I can only do with Next.JS and it will happen (TM).
