English is Useless

Yes, you heard me. English is the most useless subject taught in all schools in
the United States besides Art. Anything past 7th grade is useless knowledge. Do
I care about how many words Shakespeare invented? No! I dont care about acting,
who wrote who, the meaning behind the first three paragraphs of Of Mice and
Men, or whatever Gatsby does while hes lying.

The only thing you should know is basic grammar and what different words are.
The rest, just look it up online! It isn't that hard to figure out. 

While we are on the topic of things to look up online, why does anyone use MLA
anymore?
