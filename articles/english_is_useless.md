English is Useless

Yes, you heard me. English is the most useless subject taught in all schools in
the United States besides Art. The language isn't useless, but the subject sure
is Anything past 7th grade is useless knowledge. Do I care about how many words
Shakespeare invented? No! I dont care about acting, who wrote who, the meaning
behind the first three paragraphs of Of Mice and Men, or whatever Gatsby does
while hes lying.

The only thing you should know is basic grammar and what different words are.
The rest, just look it up online! It isn't that hard to figure out. 

While we are on the topic of things to look up online, why does anyone use MLA
anymore? It's so informal and it just looks plain bad. Chicago manual style is
miles better, plus it allows the person to use Bible quotations easily without
having to cite the author of the Bible (because its God (:< ). Plus I'm pretty sure
that you are supposed to use a Sans font when you are writing MLA, but you use a
Sans-Serif (specifically Times New Roman, the best font! besides FiraCode) for 
Chicago which makes it look much more formal and not like a high-schoolers not-even
-tried-on research paper.

Before all you English majors decide to write an 8 page formatted APA paper
about why this stupid blog post is wrong, let me just implant one tiny little
thought in your seemingly endlessly large heads. Are you really going to use all
these knowledge in the real world? I know that you use the same argument with
mathematics, but the fact is that calculus is used much more in daily life than
wether the Garden of Eden is significant in Of Mice and Men. Should everyone
read classical literature? Sure, if you want to, but time would be better spent
actually improving your life somewhat. Learn to kayak, woodwork, or weld. Do something
other than spending your entire life in a seculded environmenmt where you are sheltered
beyond belief.

PS. Most of this is not serious, I am personally very biased against English (the subject)
I really dont care.
