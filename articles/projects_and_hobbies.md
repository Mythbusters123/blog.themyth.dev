Projects and Hobbies are... Hard

Projects are fun, if you like doing them. For example, Cars. Recently I have
become super invested in cars and even though I am a poor teenager, I really
want to work on one.

Another project I have is upgrading my computer. For you tech nerds my specs
are listed below.
- CPU: i5-8400
- Motherboard: MSI B360M Bazooka
- RAM: Trident Z 2x8GB DDR4-3600MHz
- GPU: Some MSI 1060 3GB
- Storage: ADATA 256GB SSD (Windows), 2TB Toshiba (Big storage drive), 500GB Crucial MX
If you cannot tell, this is a prebuilt.
