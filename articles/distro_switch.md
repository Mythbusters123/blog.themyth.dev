The Distro Switch: Part 1 -- Preparation

For a while now, I have been wanting to switch over to Artix Linux, and lay
waste to my over-bloated Arch system. My current system is very slow, has over
1700 packages installed, it uses KDE, and it's home folder is so over-bloated it
physically hurts to ls -la. This is why I have a LARBS sticker in the footer,
because I have been using it for upwards of a month now and with my
modifications I have zero issues with it.

The main issue holding me back is my configuration files: specifically SSH and
GnuPG, but also with other programs. But I cannot just throw my .config into a
tar file and call it a day. I actually don't have a NAS (but might create one
soon if we don't fall into a bottomless abyss) so sadly I pay Google $2.99/month
now. I'm a poor kid, I'm not gonna pay $15/month for 1GB of storage on a
privacy-respecting cloud provider, when I could just pay 3/month at Google, for
now anyway. When I build a NAS, that should all be taken care of. 

But its not just a distro switch I want (really need) to do. I dual boot
Windows, for school and other purposes, and that install is also getting heavily
bloated, by the day (that I use it, which is like 2 days/week).
